ABCs conducts laboratory- and population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). ABCs serotype data are used to measure the impact of vaccine use in the United States on vaccine-type IPD. This table reports IPD case counts in the ABCs catchment area by serotype for years 1998 through 2022. Cases are grouped into the following mutually exclusive age groups: age <2 years old, age 2–4 years old, age 5–17 years old, age 18–49 years old, age 50–64 years old, and age ≥65 years old. ABCs methods and surveillance areas reporting IPD cases has changed over time. Given these changes, trends in serotype distribution by year and age group should be interpreted with caution. Additional information on ABCs methods and surveillance population is available at https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/methodology/index.html. Analyze and visualize data using the ABCs Bact Facts Interactive Data Dashboard at https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/bact-facts-interactive-dashboard. *ABCs IPD Isolates were serotyped by Quellung, PCR, or whole genome sequencing (WGS). **Cases without an isolate available or with mixed serotypes reported are listed on the table as “MISS.” Additionally, non-typeable IPD cases are shown as “NT.” ***Zero cell rows were not included in this dataset. ****Minor changes to previous years' serotype data can occur as additional isolates and serotype data become available. *****Cases were excluded from this dataset if the ABCs site did not perform surveillance in the catchment area for a full calendar year. As a result, cases were excluded from the following sites: TN, 11 counties, Jul-Dec 1999; CO, 5 counties, Jul-Dec 2000; CA, 2 counties (aged <5 years), Oct-Dec 2000.",

ABCs serotype data are used to measure the impact of vaccine use in the United States on vaccine-type IPD. This table reports IPD case counts in the ABCs catchment area by serotype for years 1998 through 2022. Cases are grouped into the following mutually exclusive age groups: age <2 years old, age 2–4 years old, age 5–17 years old, age 18–49 years old, age 50–64 years old, and age ≥65 years old. ABCs methods and surveillance areas reporting IPD cases has changed over time. Given these changes, trends in serotype distribution by year and age group should be interpreted with caution. Additional information on ABCs methods and surveillance population is available at https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/methodology/index.html. Analyze and visualize data using the ABCs Bact Facts Interactive Data Dashboard at https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/bact-facts-interactive-dashboard. *ABCs IPD Isolates were serotyped by Quellung, PCR, or whole genome sequencing (WGS). **Cases without an isolate available or with mixed serotypes reported are listed on the table as “MISS.” Additionally, non-typeable IPD cases are shown as “NT.” ***Zero cell rows were not included in this dataset. ****Minor changes to previous years' serotype data can occur as additional isolates and serotype data become available. *****Cases were excluded from this dataset if the ABCs site did not perform surveillance in the catchment area for a full calendar year. As a result, cases were excluded from the following sites: TN, 11 counties, Jul-Dec 1999; CO, 5 counties, Jul-Dec 2000; CA, 2 counties (aged <5 years), Oct-Dec 2000.",
